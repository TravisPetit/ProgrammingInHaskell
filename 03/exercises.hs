{- Exercises 5
It is not just infeasible, but rather impossible. Here's a short proof.
Let H be the type of all Haskell programs.
Let exec :: H -> Bool be a function that runs a program and returns True if it terminates and False otherwise.
Let f :: H -> Bool, f _ = True.
Then we could use exec p == f p to solve the Halting Problem, which we know is impossible.
Therefore a faithful implementation of Eq cannot exist.
