-- Exercise 1
data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat deriving Show

add Zero n = n
add (Succ m) n = Succ (add m n)

mult :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat
mult Zero n = Zero

-- Exercise 2
data Tree a = Leaf a | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a)

occurs :: Ord a => a -> Tree a -> Bool
occurs x (Leaf y) = x == y
occurs x (Node l y r)
    | result == EQ = True
    | result == LT = occurs x l
    | otherwise = occurs x r
    where result = compare x y
-- This is better because x and y are only compared once. In the other version they can be compared once or twice

-- Exercise 3

countLeaves :: Tree' a -> Int

-- Exercise 4
halve :: [a] -> ([a], [a])

-- Exercise 5

eval :: Expr -> Int

size :: Expr -> Int

-- Exercise 7
-- I have to redefine maybe so I don't get an error:
data Maybe' a = Nothing' | Just' a deriving Show

instance Eq a => Eq (Maybe' a) where
    Nothing' == Nothing' = True
    Just' x == Just' y = (x == y)
    _ == _ = False
-- IMO it would also make sense to set
-- Nothing' == Nothing' = False
